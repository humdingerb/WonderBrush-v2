# WonderBrush 2.1.2
WonderBrush is a vector/bitmap graphics application for the Haiku operating system. See http://yellowbites.com/wonderbrush.html for more details. To learn more about Haiku, visit https://haiku-os.org.

This is the last known version of the code for WonderBrush as it is included in Haiku, restored from a backup and stripped
off the SVN stuff and most code which should not be necessary to build WonderBrush.

A new buildsystem (based on the Jamfile engine) allows to compile WonderBrush from these sources.

If someone wants to port to a new architecture, I am looking forward to pull requests.
Consider contributing to https://github.com/stippi/WonderBrush-v3 for new features and other improvements, as this version 2 is now in maintenance mode.
